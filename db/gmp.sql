It is essential for cognitive health and may help improve memory and reduce the risk of neurological disorders.\r\n\r\n10. **Promotes Muscle Growth:**\r\n    - Due to its high protein content, paneer is excellent for muscle building and recovery. It is particularly beneficial for athletes and bodybuilders to repair muscle tissues after workouts.\r\n\r\n### How to Eat Paneer:\r\n\r\n1. **Raw or Plain Paneer:**\r\n   - Paneer can be eaten raw as a snack. Just cut it into cubes or slices and sprinkle a little salt and pepper, or eat it with chutney or sauces for added flavor.\r\n\r\n2. **Paneer Bhurji:**\r\n   - Paneer bhurji is a scrambled paneer dish made by crumbling paneer and sautÃ©ing it with onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and spices. It\'s a quick and delicious dish often served with bread or roti.\r\n\r\n3. **Paneer Tikka:**\r\n   - Paneer tikka is a popular appetizer where paneer cubes are marinated in yogurt, spices, and herbs and then grilled or baked. It\'s a smoky, flavorful dish served with mint chutney.\r\n\r\n4. **Paneer in Curries:**\r\n   - Paneer is widely used in rich, creamy Indian curries like **Paneer Butter Masala**, **Shahi Paneer**, or **Palak Paneer** (paneer in spinach gravy). These dishes are often paired with naan or rice.\r\n\r\n5. **Paneer Paratha:**\r\n   - Paneer is stuffed into whole wheat dough to make paneer parathas, a popular North Indian flatbread. It is usually served with yogurt or pickles.\r\n\r\n6. **Paneer Salads:**\r\n   - Add cubed paneer to salads for a protein boost. Paneer pairs well with fresh vegetables, herbs, and light dressings like olive oil, lemon, or balsamic vinegar.\r\n\r\n7. **Paneer Wraps and Rolls:**\r\n   - Paneer is often used as a filling in wraps and rolls, along with vegetables and sauces.
